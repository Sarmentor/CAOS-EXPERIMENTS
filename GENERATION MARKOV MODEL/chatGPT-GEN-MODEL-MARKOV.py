#Certainly! Here is an example of a simple generative NLP model that uses a Markov Chain to generate text. This code generates text by taking a sequence of words and predicting the next word based on the probability of it appearing after the previous sequence of words. This is a very basic approach to NLP, but it can still produce some interesting results.

```
import random
import re

def generate_text(corpus, n):
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', corpus.lower())
    markov_dict = {}
    for i in range(len(words) - n):
        key = tuple(words[i:i+n])
        if key in markov_dict:
            markov_dict[key].append(words[i+n])
        else:
            markov_dict[key] = [words[i+n]]
    seed = random.randint(0, len(words) - n)
    seed_words = words[seed:seed+n]
    result = " ".join(seed_words)
    for i in range(100):
        key = tuple(seed_words)
        if key in markov_dict:
            possible_words = markov_dict[key]
            next_word = random.choice(possible_words)
            result += " " + next_word
            seed_words = seed_words[1:] + [next_word]
        else:
            break
    return result.capitalize() + "."

corpus = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
print(generate_text(corpus, 2))
```

#In this code, `corpus` is the input text that we want to generate new text from, and `n` is the number of words we want to use to predict the next word. The `generate_text` function first preprocesses the input text by converting it to lowercase and splitting it into individual words using regular expressions. It then builds a Markov Chain dictionary by iterating over the words and adding each n-gram (a tuple of n words) to the dictionary with its possible next words.

#Once the Markov Chain dictionary is built, the function randomly selects a seed n-gram from the input text and uses it to generate the first sequence of words in the output text. It then iteratively predicts the next word based on the previous n-gram and adds it to the output text until either 100 words have been generated or there are no more possible next words in the Markov Chain dictionary.

#Finally, the function returns the generated text with the first letter capitalized and a period at the end.

#This is a very simple example of a generative NLP model, but it can be extended and modified to suit different use cases. To make the code more efficient, you can use techniques like memoization to cache the results of expensive computations and avoid redundant computations. You can also parallelize the computation using libraries like multiprocessing or Dask to speed up the generation process.
