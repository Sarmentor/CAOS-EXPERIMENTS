#In this updated code, I've added a new parameter `lambd` which controls the chaos factor in the Markov Chain model. The `generate_text` function now calculates the probability distribution of the possible next words based on their frequency in the Markov Chain, and then uses the chaos factor to randomly choose between the most likely word and a randomly selected word from the distribution.

#The `objective` function is a new helper function that takes the `lambd` parameter and the input text, and generates a text using the `generate_text` function. It then calculates a score based on the ratio of unique words to total words in the generated text, and returns the negative of that score (since we want to maximize the score).

#The `minimize_scalar` function from the `scipy.optimize` library is then used to find the optimal value of `lambd` that maximizes the score returned by the `objective` function.

#Finally, the optimal value of `lambd` is printed along with the generated text using the `generate_text` function with the optimal value of `lambd`.

#This updated code allows the user to optimize the chaos factor to balance between generating text that is too repetitive or too random. The optimization process can take some time depending on the size of the input text and the value of `n`, but it can significantly improve the quality of the generated text.
